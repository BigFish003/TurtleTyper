# TurtleTyper
Welcome to TurtleTyper, this is used to get rid of all the annyoing maunual letter and number drawing when using the turtle module in python. You can use it after the turtle is launched and type there, or you can have it draw out the letters before. Just copy paste the code into your program, your going to want to shrink all the functions because it is 200 lines. To make it draw something after the turtle is launched, put Type() at the end of your program. To make the turtle type something itself, just put functions like one() and two() in your code and it should type it, make sure to set the position of the turtle though. You can also change the color of the turtle with color(), and you can change the size with big() and small(). Im working on adding letters, they seem to be different than numbers with keyboard input, so it may take a while. For finding versions you can look at the branches, but I will always post the latest version in main.
